#Project - Bike-sharing-assignment[29 Oct'24]

A bike-sharing system is a service where bikes are available for shared use for the individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled where as the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

# General Information
A US bike-sharing service provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable drop in their revenues because of Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the lockdown comes to an end. Also the economy and revenue restores to a healthy state. 

In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.


They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:
